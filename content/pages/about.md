# Me

My name is Jens.  
I'm a software developer grown into a people manager role. Read more about my professional career in my [CV](/pages/cv).

I like all things Python. Like this blog is made with [Pelican](https://getpelican.com) or [my home automation](https://github.com/lociii/homeassistant-config) is running on [HomeAssistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).

In my spare time, I enjoy [computer games](https://steamcommunity.com/id/myrmidons_loci/) and tinkering with [my home](https://wohnung.jensnistler.de/).

# Projects

## CS:GO game state integration for HomeAssistant

The [integration](https://github.com/lociii/homeassistant-csgo) can make your home react to the state of your game.  
e.g. blink your RGB lighting when the bomb has been planted.

### HomeAssistant digitalSTROM

I've built an [API client](https://github.com/lociii/pydigitalstrom) and a [custom component ](https://github.com/lociii/homeassistant-digitalstrom) to integrate [digitalSTROM](https://www.digitalstrom.com) home automation systems into [HomeAssistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).  
Then I screwed it all and replaced them with ESP based micro controllers like [Gosund SP111](https://www.google.com/search?q=gosund+sp111) and [Shelly devices](https://shelly.cloud/) - because free and open is much better then proprietary and heavily overpriced crap.
